/**
 * Bhava lagna (BL) — one sign per 5 ghatis (120 minutes) from the Sun's sunrise
 * longitude, i.e. 0.25° per minute.
 *
 * CORRECTED in BPHS Programme Part 2 (conflict `bphs.05.002`). This previously advanced
 * at 1°/min — four times too fast — because the first corpus's worked example implied
 * that rate, even though its own prose said "one rasi per 2 hours", which is exactly the
 * 5 ghatis BPHS gives. The evidence now runs 3:1 the other way:
 *
 *   1. BPHS 5.2-3's prose and its worked example agree with each other.
 *   2. The first corpus's prose also agrees with BPHS; only its example dissents, and
 *      that inconsistency was already noted in the comment this one replaces.
 *   3. BPHS's three rates descend cleanly — 5, 2.5, 1 ghatis for Bhava, Hora, Ghatika.
 *      The old rate implies 1.25 ghatis, which would make Bhava lagna FASTER than Hora
 *      lagna and breaks the ordering the chapter is built on.
 *
 * Hora and Ghati lagna below were already correct and are untouched — they reproduce
 * both corpora's examples identically.
